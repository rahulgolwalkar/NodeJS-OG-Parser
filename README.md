# NodeJS-OG-Parser

This was primarily developed for https://bottr.me  . 

Realising that there are no open OG Parsers for Node, the snippet was made and hoping that would be useful for other fellow witches and wizards.
This Node code snippet takes in a "url" as the input and return OG parameters. 
It is quite basic , you may contribute
